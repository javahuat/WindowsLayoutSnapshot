Hi,

I see this project is not maintained for years.

But there are a lot of good forks, my suggestion is to select/create a new fork, and do all the changes from the other forks there.

Then create a community and so on.

See the forks here: https://techgaun.github.io/active-forks/index.html#https://github.com/adamsmith/WindowsLayoutSnapshot
